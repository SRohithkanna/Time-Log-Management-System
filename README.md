# Time Log Management System

A full-stack web application designed to manage and track time logs efficiently. The application supports complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing users to add, view, update, and delete time log entries through a user-friendly interface.

The frontend is built using React.js for a responsive and interactive experience, while the backend is developed using Node.js and Express.js. MongoDB is used as the database, with Mongoose handling schema definition and database operations.

This project demonstrates practical full-stack development skills, including RESTful API design, frontend–backend integration, and database management.
